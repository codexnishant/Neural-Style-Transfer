# Neural-Style-Transfer
Tensorflow implementation of the paper "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style" by Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker, Matthias Bethge" (Link : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576.pdf )

Implemented the neural style transfer algorithm in Tensorflow to generate novel artistic images using the algorithm.The algorithm uses a pretrained VGG-19 network with weights trained on ImageNet dataset. The implementation optimizes a cost function comprising of the Content loss and the Style loss to get a set of learned values, in this case, the pixel values of the learned randomly initialized image.
